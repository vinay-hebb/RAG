Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with generative language models.
It retrieves context from a knowledge base and feeds it to a generator, improving factuality and grounding.
Key components include chunking source documents, embedding them into vectors, storing them in a vector database, and retrieving the top relevant chunks for a query.
Choosing chunk sizes that match model context and adding metadata like source and section helps with traceability and filtering.
RAG systems often cite sources, apply safety filters, and refresh their indexes as content changes.
